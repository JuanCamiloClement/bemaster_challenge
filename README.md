# Challenge App!

This project was developed using React.js for the frontend and Sass as a preprocessor for CSS.

## Characteristics of the project:
- It is a video content service.
- Allows the user to watch videos of different categories.
- Registered users can sign in (if everything is valid!)

## Start running üöÄ

These instructions will allow you to obtain a copy of the running project in your local machine, for the purpose of development.

### Prerequisites üìã

The things you will need to install the software are a computer that isn't too old and a text editor to help you read all the code with pretty colors.

### Installation üîß

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 
```
git clone git@github.com:JuanCamiloClement/bemaster_challenge.git
```
2. Change directory to /bemaster_app:
```
cd bemaster_app
```

3. Install the dependencies:

Make sure to have installed Node.js:
```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Then, run npm install on each of the repositories:
```
npm install
```

4. Run the code!

Make sure to be in the repository:
```
cd bemaster_app
```
Once there, execute
```
npm run dev
```
5. Remember the data is mocked! You will find the registered users, with their emails and passwords in `./src/assets/data/index.ts`, in the `users` variable.

In case you don't want to look so deep into folders, we can show you one from here:
```
email: juan@test.com
password: juan12345
```

Enjoy!
